# Advanced Risk Modeling for Insurance Claims



## Overview
Innovated a bivariate composite distribution combining Exponential and Exponentially Tempering Developed a
cutting-edge statistical model to accurately predict and manage insurance claim costs for the Danish market, utilizing a
comprehensive dataset of Danish insurance claims.
 Leveraged the unique characteristics of 2,167 Danish insurance claims (e.g., heavy-tailed claim
distributions, complex dependencies between claim types) to create a highly tailored risk model.
 Constructed a novel composite distribution combining Exponential and Exponentially Tempering
Pareto components to effectively capture the extreme value behavior of Danish insurance claims.
 Employed a sophisticated copula-based approach (Joe copula) to accurately model the intricate
relationships between different types of claims within the Danish insurance dataset.
 Rigorously validated the model using the entire Danish insurance dataset, demonstrating superior
performance in predicting and managing insurance risks compared to traditional methods.
 Communicated findings effectively through a detailed research report and engaging presentation.
